# Node JSON logger

This library provides a minimal JSON logging interface suitable for use in microservices - see the parent project [here](https://github.com/ygt/microservice-logging)

## Install

    npm install --save microservice-logging

## Examples of use (CoffeeScript)

All of the following code can be found [here](node/example-app.coffee)

Instantiate a new logger like this:

    Logger = require './logger'

    log = new Logger
      now: Date.now
      output: console
      events:
        startup: 'startup'
        exception: 'exception'
        httpRequest: 'HTTP request'
        query: 'SQL query'
    .with
      service: 'my super service'

You can then use the logger by invoking it like so:

    log.startup.error
      message: 'Emergency! There's an Emergency going on'

This will output:

    {"service":"my super service","timestamp":1468333486800,"event_type":"startup","severity":"ERROR","message":"Emergency! There's an Emergency going on"}

Although, obviously, the timestamp attribute will be different - this is the number of seconds since the epoch, in case you were wondering. If you want to add specific information (like request data) you can do so like this:

    log.httpRequest.info
      correlation_id: '126bb6fa-28a2-470f-b013-eefbf9182b2d'
      request:
        method: 'GET'
      response:
        status: 200

Which prints:

    {"service":"my super service","timestamp":1468333607265,"event_type":"HTTP request","severity":"INFO","correlation_id":"126bb6fa-28a2-470f-b013-eefbf9182b2d","request":{"method":"GET"},"response":{"status":200}}

## Examples of use (ES6)

All of the following code can be found [here](node/example-app.coffee)

Instantiate a new logger like this:

    const Logger = require('./logger')

    const log = new Logger({
      now: Date.now,
      output: console,
      events: {
        startup: 'startup',
        exception: 'exception',
        httpRequest: 'HTTP request',
        query: 'SQL query'
      }
    })

    const service_logger = log.with({ service: 'my super service' })

You can then use the logger by invoking it like so:

    log.startup.error({
      message: "Emergency! There's an Emergency going on"
    })

This will output:

    {"service":"my super service","timestamp":1468333486800,"event_type":"startup","severity":"ERROR","message":"Emergency! There's an Emergency going on"}

Although, obviously, the timestamp attribute will be different - this is the number of seconds since the epoch, in case you were wondering. If you want to add specific information (like request data) you can do so like this:

    log.httpRequest.info({
      correlation_id: '126bb6fa-28a2-470f-b013-eefbf9182b2d',
      request: { method: 'GET' },
      response: { status: 200 }
    })


Which prints:

    {"service":"my super service","timestamp":1468333607265,"event_type":"HTTP request","severity":"INFO","correlation_id":"126bb6fa-28a2-470f-b013-eefbf9182b2d","request":{"method":"GET"},"response":{"status":200}}

## Examples of use (ES5)

All of the following code can be found [here](node/example-app.coffee)

Instantiate a new logger like this:

    var Logger, log, service_logger;

    Logger = require('./logger');

    log = new Logger({
      now: Date.now,
      output: console,
      events: {
        startup: 'startup',
        exception: 'exception',
        httpRequest: 'HTTP request',
        query: 'SQL query'
      }
    })

    service_logger = log.with({
      service: 'my super service'
    });

You can then use the logger by invoking it like so:

    log.startup.error({
      message: "Emergency! There's an Emergency going on"
    });

This will output:

    {"service":"my super service","timestamp":1468333486800,"event_type":"startup","severity":"ERROR","message":"Emergency! There's an Emergency going on"}

      request: { method: 'GET' },
      response: { status: 200 }
    });

Which prints:

    {"service":"my super service","timestamp":1468333607265,"event_type":"HTTP request","severity":"INFO","correlation_id":"126bb6fa-28a2-470f-b013-eefbf9182b2d","request":{"method":"GET"},"response":{"status":200}}
