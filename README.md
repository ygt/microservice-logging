# Microservice Logging

This is a machine-readable first, human-readable second, JSON-based logging micro-library suitable for a wide variety of microservice uses. Currently [Your Golf Travel](http://www.yourgolftravel.com/) are using this for our production microservice architecture, based upon Google's 'Kontainer' Engine ([Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Heroku's [12-factor app](http://12factor.net/) pattern.

The logging library is provided in a number of language formats:
* [Node.js](node)
  - CoffeeScript
  - JavaScript ES6
  - JavaScript ES5
  - For more details see the Node-specific [README](node/README.md)
* [Ruby](ruby)
* [Elixir](elixir)
* [Go](go)
* More to follow...
